# Physics Coding Projects

This repo contains physics-based coding projects I've completed in my Engineering Physics Class and implementing my own.

## Projects

- **Projectile Motion:** Simulating motion with and without air resistance.
- **Air Drag Simulation:** Modeling Felix Baumgartnerâ€™s stratospheric jump using altitude-based drag.

## Tools Used

- Jupyter Notebook (via Miniconda)
- Python libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy

## How to Run

Install required packages using:

```bash
conda install numpy matplotlib scipy jupyter
